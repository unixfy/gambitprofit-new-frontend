It’s really only worth using if you follow the strategies on this website, as the cuts they take make it quite poor for actual sports betting. If you want to actually bet on sports, there are many other (better) websites out there."

As long as you make more than 900 tokens from any bet of 1000 tokens, that bet is profitable. Plus, you can choose the amount of Gambit tokens you convert back to Swagbucks at one time. This is super useful for getting the Swagbucks daily goals, the rewards for which can be up to $200/month for doing nothing!"

Please note: your Gambit account email must be the same as your Swagbucks account email to receive tokens."

                    "q": "Can you tell me about the different betting methods?",
                    "a": "Risky betting: You bet on only one team (or side) of each game. This team is picked specifically by me because it has a relatively low chance of losing (usually less than 10% chance of losing). This will yield, by far, the most rewards, but also carries some degree of risk. Ultimately, this method can still be profitable even if you lose some bets. <br><br>Med-risk betting: You bet on 2 of 3 teams in a soccer match. The two teams you bet on are picked specifically because they have a relatively high chance of winning. This will yield more rewards than no-risk betting but less rewards than risky betting. <br><br>No-risk betting: You bet on every team (or side) of each game. The amount you bet on each team is calculated such that you will receive the same amount of tokens, regardless of which team wins. This totally eliminates the risk, but also means lower rewards (about half to 2/3 of the rewards of risky betting). <br><br>Overall, the reward you earn has a strong correlation with the amount of risk in a bet."
